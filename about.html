			<h2 align="center">About Champaign Urbana 2600</h2>

			<p>Like other <a href="https://2600.com">2600</a> <a href="https://www.2600.com/meetings/">meetings</a>, CU2600 is a monthly gathering for people who are interested in technology, how people use it, and how it works.  Many regular attendees are especially interested in security, privacy, cryptography, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d4RtvMQp10">similar topics</a>.  People of any age and skill level are welcome.</p>

			<p>Meetings are the first Friday of each month on <a href="#where">Mezzanine of Harvest Market</a> in Champaign, IL.  Someone will be there from 18:00 until at least 19:00, maybe 20:00. Sometimes people bring a presentation that they're going to give at a conference, other people bring a project for show &amp; tell, sometimes we talk about problems and try point one another to similar projects that might be helpful. Asking questions and playing with whatever fun technology we brought is encouraged.  &quot;We&quot; means you and whoever else shows up, so bring your projects!  We do NOT do anything illegal, harm our venue, or judge or harrass fellow attendees.</p>

			<p>People attend 2600 meetings for many reasons.  Some common reasons are to learn how things work, to meet other people who share your interests, to share your knowledge, to get help with a security problem or project, and to find out what other people are working on.</p>
